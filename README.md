#Flint [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdibiccari/flint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdibiccari/flint)

Quick Start
------------
    * clone this repository
    * cd flint/
    * create and activate a virtualenv
    * pip install --editable .
    * enter flint --help for usage options


Running Tests
------------
	* install with test dependencies: pip install --editable .[test]
	* py.test [--cov flint]


To-Do
------------
	* logging
	* packaging for distribution (package database files)
	* better test organization


Design Decisions
------------
Language choice: Python
	* I work with python every day in a web app context but have never built a command line tool with it
Command line tool package: Click
	* Argument and option parsing
	* Defaults and arg type enforcement
	* Generates help text
	* Nest commands and pass context
	* Some testing support
Database vs in-memory storage:
	* Sqlite --> file-based db, standard lib module for db interaction
	* Take advantage of database col types and unique constraints to prevent some errors, validate
Retrospective:
	* Click documentation was a little lacking/disjointed for complex examples
	* If I were to make it again I think it would be fun to use python standard lib modules for as much as possible
		* Replacing Click with cmd and argparse? Create an interactive shell/repl vs a command line tool a la git?
